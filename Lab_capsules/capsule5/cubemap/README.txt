Building:

In the lab use the CMakeList.lab.txt
Mv CMakeList.lab.txt CMakeList.txt

In your own Windows, Linux or Mac system you need to edit the CMakeList.txt and add your own folder structure

Note that We do not have the bandwidth to support all your home systems. We only support the lab configuration. 


1) Create build folder: mkdir build
2) cd build
3) cmake ../
4) make

Rumnning:
 ./lab01
